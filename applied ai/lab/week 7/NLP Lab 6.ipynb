    "## Exercise: Expanding Rule-Based Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Your goal is to apply TextBlob for sentiment analysis on various types of text, interpret the results (polarity and subjectivity), and potentially extend its functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Installation (if necessary):** Ensure `textblob` is installed. If not, run the provided `pip install` command in a code cell.\n",
    "2.  **Analyze Diverse Texts:** Use the provided TextBlob sentiment analysis code on the following sentences:\n",
    "    *   **Positive:** \"The weather is absolutely beautiful today, I'm so happy!\"\n",
    "    *   **Negative:** \"I am extremely disappointed with the service; it was terrible.\"\n",
    "    *   **Neutral:** \"The capital of France is Paris.\"\n",
    "    *   **Mixed:** \"The movie had a great plot, but the acting was dreadful.\"\n",
    "3.  **Interpret Polarity and Subjectivity:** For each sentence, note down the `polarity` and `subjectivity` scores. Explain in your own words what each score indicates for that specific sentence.\n",
    "4.  **Batch Processing (Optional Challenge):** Write a simple Python function that takes a list of sentences and returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the original sentence, its polarity, and its subjectivity.\n",
    "5.  **Reflect:** How well does TextBlob handle neutral sentences or sentences with mixed sentiments?"

    "### Challenges: Advanced Sentiment Categorization and Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Define Sentiment Categories:** Create a Python function, `get_sentiment_category(polarity_score)`, that takes a polarity score as input and returns one of three strings: \"Positive\", \"Negative\", or \"Neutral\". You will need to define clear thresholds for these categories (e.g., polarity > 0.1 for Positive, polarity < -0.1 for Negative, otherwise Neutral).\n",
    "2.  **Apply Categorization:** Modify the `analyze_sentences` function (or create a new function) to include this sentiment category in the output dictionary for each sentence.\n",
    "3.  **Calculate Distribution:** After processing the sentences, calculate and print the total count or percentage of sentences falling into each category (Positive, Negative, Neutral).\n",
    "4.  **(Optional) Visualize Distribution:** Use a library like `matplotlib` or `seaborn` to create a bar chart showing the distribution of sentiment categories."
